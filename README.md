# SVG-Logo-Maker
        
## Description

I was motivared in this challenge to be able to make my own logo so I don't have to hire a graphic designer to make one. The goal I wanted to accomplish was after a series of questions a SVG Logo is generated and I can view it in the browser. I also wanted to be able to run tests for my shapes to know that they would generate. I learned how to create a SVG with some xml to view in browser and also learned how to write a test and let them run with jest.
